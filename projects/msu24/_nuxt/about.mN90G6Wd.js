Mathematicians came up with proofs, but none of them turned out to be correct. This problem went unproven for over 100 years until in 1976, two researchers at the University of Illinois finally proved the <b data-v-abf79aa2>four color theorem</b>. This theorem states that any planar map can be colored in with just 4 colors. The proof was controversial at the time and historical nowadays because it was the first math theorem to be proven with computer assistance.</p><div class="spacer" data-v-abf79aa2><span data-v-abf79aa2>​</span></div><p class="subhero-text" data-v-abf79aa2>Creative math</p><p class="text-body" data-v-abf79aa2>The problem of coloring in a map is more formally called <b data-v-abf79aa2>graph coloring</b>, and is a problem inside of an area of math called <b data-v-abf79aa2>graph theory</b>. Graph theory is the study of webs (or <i data-v-abf79aa2>networks</i>) of data and how pieces of data connect to and relate to each other. Graph theory is categorized under the larger branch of <b data-v-abf79aa2>discrete mathematics</b>. Here a graph means one or more locations represented as a circle (a vertex) connected to each other in different ways with lines (edges). This type of graph is very different from the kind in geometry with an x and y axis, but they are both are similar in that they visualize something.</p><img class="midwest-img" src="'+m+'" data-v-abf79aa2><div class="spacer" data-v-abf79aa2><span data-v-abf79aa2>​</span></div><p class="subhero-text" data-v-abf79aa2>Computers</p><p class="text-body" data-v-abf79aa2> Graph coloring can be thought of a <b data-v-abf79aa2>constraint satisfaction problem</b>. A computer solves this problem by simply following a list of steps, like following a recipe in a cookbook. This list of steps is called an algorithm. Here are some steps taken from real algorithms to help you think like a computer: <ul data-v-abf79aa2><li data-v-abf79aa2>Start with a state that touch lots of other states first.
