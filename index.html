                Hi, I work as a developer at <a href="https://skritter.com" target="_blank">Skritter</a> making web and mobile apps, with a tich of graphic design thrown in. JavaScript is pretty cool, but so are Python, C#, MongoDB, SQL, Photoshop, After Effects, and Lightwave. Someday I'll bother to actually make this into a real website. 
                <p>
                In my spare time, I like to study linguistics and butcher foreign languages in attempts at communication. I've lived in Russia and Taiwan, and have an upcoming trip to Peru.
                </p>

                    <li><a href="projects/trade_v0.3/index.html" target="blank">Trade Simulator (work in progress)</a><span class="description"> - web app - A "game" that orgininally started as a way to lean the bare metal workings of the HTML Canvas. It challenges definitions of such words as "fun," "entertaining," and "playable," but nonetheless has been an interesting project to architect and implement from the ground up using no existing canvas or game frameworks.</span></li>

                    <li>Latin Language Coach (work in progress)<span class="description"> - web app - spaced-repetition-based tool to help learn Latin. Made iteratively to help me learn more effectively. Started in Python/sqlite with an AngularJS frontend. Link coming soon.</span></li>
